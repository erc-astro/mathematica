Calculates the self-similar solutions for the coasting-to-energy-conserving regime, described in Coughlin (2024) (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240910600C/abstract). You are (of course) free to use, modify, extend, etc. this notebook; I only ask that the research that results from such usage cite the paper for which the code was originally developed: Coughlin & Begelman (2024) (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240910600C/abstract)
