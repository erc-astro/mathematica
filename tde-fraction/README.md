This notebook calculates the fraction of TDEs (i.e., the rate of TDEs, given the rate at which the loss cone is filled [i.e., the rate at which stars are scattered onto orbits with pericenter distances less than the tidal radius]) as a function of black hole spin in the Kerr metric. It assumes that stars are isotropically distributed in angular momentum space, implying that the loss cone is full and we are in the pinhole regime.
